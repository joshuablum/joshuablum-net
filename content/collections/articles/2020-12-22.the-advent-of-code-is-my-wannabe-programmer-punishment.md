The year of 2020 is coming to an end and what better way to let it go out the door than to take on a big challenge.
I wanted to improve on my programming skills and what better way to do so as to solve a new puzzle every day for 25 days in a row.
Well, I am kinda late to the party for today already is the 22nd of December but my goal is to complete this years Advent calendar until the end of this year.
The stretched goal is to also complete all challenges from prior years. It dates back to 2015 so there are a total of (using some complex multiplication math here) 150 puzzles waiting to be solved.
And why stop there?
I claim to be a web and iOS developer so having really two main programming languages on my toolbelt there are going to be two repositories for where I publish the solutions.
One of them for [JavaScript](https://github.com/joshuablum/advent-of-code-js) and the other one for [Swift](https://github.com/joshuablum/advent-of-code-swift).
The most solutions of the most recent Calendar are going to live in the main branch and past ones in brnaches named after the years.
This is probably going to be a living doucment which I am going to update at different times complaining about how hard some tasks might be or just to be sad and cry about data structures and algorithms.

**Merry Christmas and happy coding!** 🎅🏻
